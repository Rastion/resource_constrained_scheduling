    "description": "In the RCPSP, a set of tasks must be scheduled subject to precedence and renewable resource constraints. Each task has a fixed duration and consumes a given amount of each resource while in progress. Resources have limited capacities. The goal is to minimize the makespan (the time when all tasks are completed). This instance follows the Patterson format.",
